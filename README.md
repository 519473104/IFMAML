# IFMAML
An information fusion-based meta transfer learning method for few-shot fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions

The file of Tsinghua.py is the operation of information fusion. You can use it in your dataset.

The 2D-MAML model is proposed inspire by the paper Meta-learning as a promising approach for few-shot cross-domain fault diagnosis: Algorithms, applications, and prospects.
